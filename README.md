  # üë©‚Äçüíª About

The present application is being desgined with the intention of showcasing MySQL skills while being able to provide interactivity, by simulating the database of a generic company;
and allowing the user to modify core information from the database such as:

* View employees | departments | roles | salaries.

* Delete employees | departments | roles.


It's important to mention that  as of 11/15/2023, the present code is not completed at all, there are compatibility issues between inquirer and mysql2 packages, that is making impossible to
intertact with the database from the command line by running JS code.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: 11/17/2023 the application has been fixed by approaching the missmatch among the passwords for the database and MySQL server.
